Brits have revealed their best-loved Christmas traditions, including watching festive films, wearing Christmas jumpers—and tucking into turkey sandwiches on
Boxing Day. A survey of 2,000 adults found Christmas dinner to be the top tradition over the festive period, while listening to Christmas songs and putting
a mince pie out for Santa on Christmas Eve also featured in the top 20. The poll also found 53 percent believe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has made
them value Christmas traditions more than they’d realized. But going to a pantomime, shopping in-store, and going out for drinks on Christmas Eve were among
the loved traditions that Brits now feel uncomfortable doing following lockdowns. The survey further revealed that 41 percent believe the traditions they follow
have changed over the years—with 35 percent having adapted their traditions in a bid to be less materialistic, while 32 percent have altered their traditions
for their children. Francesca Savage, Head of Christmas at Save The Children, which commissioned the poll to celebrate its tenth Christmas Jumper Day this Friday
(December 10), said, For many of us, the traditions we take part in at Christmas are what make the festive period something we look forward to.
